      <h1>Using GitHub for Collaboration: Challenges and Learning</h1>
      <p>To collaborate effectively, we utilized GitHub. As complete novices to this platform, it took considerable effort to understand its purpose and how to use it. Through extensive self-study, we realized that GitHub is a crucial tool for working together on a project and sharing our code with each other. </p>
      <h2>GitHub Progress</h2>

      <p>In the first image (Figure 1, Commit History), one can observe our initial struggles with understanding GitHub, where we had to experiment extensively. In the second image (Figure 2, Commit History), however, we can see significant improvement as we eventually grasped the correct usage of the platform.
        The third image (Figure 3, Changes) showcases the modifications we started making to each other's code or to the code in general. In the final image (Figure 4, Changes), we illustrate the process of changing comments from Norwegian to English.</p>
      <h2>Challenges Encountered</h2>
      <p>GitHub appears to be a very helpful platform for programmers, but as complete beginners we encountered several challenges. 
        <li>We found it daunting to merge our branches because we were afraid of potentially breaking the code or causing code overlaps.</li>
        <li>There were many unfamiliar terms for us, such as merge, branch, commit, and repository, which made it difficult to understand what we were clicking on or the function of each feature.</li> 
        <li>We watched YouTube videos and asked teaching assistants for help, but found the pace too fast. Ultimately, the only way we managed to solve our issues was through trial and error until we started to comprehend the platform's functionalities.</li>
